# Coding Challenges

This repository contains Python solutions to three coding challenges. Each challenge is explained below along with its corresponding Python function.

## Challenge 1: 12-hour to 24-hour Time Conversion

### Function: `convert`

This function takes a string representing a time in 12-hour format (e.g., "01:58:42PM") and converts it to 24-hour format (e.g., "1358"). It handles special cases like midnight (12:00 AM) and noon (12:00 PM).

#### Example Usage:

```python
time = "08:30:42PM"
print("12-hour Format time:", time)
print("24-hour Format time:", convert(time))


Function: exactly_two_positive
This function takes three integers (a, b, and c) as input and returns True if exactly two of them are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False otherwise.

This function takes a lowercase string containing alphabetic characters only (no spaces) and calculates the highest value of consonant substrings based on the provided mapping (a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26). Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou."
